<dd>God Of War 2018</dd>
<dt>Originally released for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4">ps4</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5">ps5</a> this game has 3 previous parts this is the fourth installment in the series and I persnoally like it from the designs to the combat system though lacking some old vibes of <a href="https://youtu.be/mKh7yVLvYzw">brutal moves</a> it still holds true to its title</dt>

<dd>Dragon Ball z Kakrot</dd>
<dt>As a anime fan this game brings back the old memory of watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214341/?_encoding=UTF8">dragon ball z</a>. This game is a open world rpg and lets you play as anyone from the dragon ball z main cast. This is the first open world anime game and i love it for this reason.</dt>

<dd>Pokemon Sword And Shield</dd>
<dt>This is the latest installment in the long running pokemon games series. This is the first open world pokemon game with free roam and connect and play with friends. The nostaligic factor has a biig bias for this game.</dt>
