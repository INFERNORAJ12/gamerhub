<dd>Total Overdose</dd>
<dt>I like this game as my faviorte nostalgic game is becase its the first ever pc game that I own as a child. This game has a very funny and wacky story. We are <a href="https://totaloverdose.fandom.com/wiki/Ramiro_Cruz">Ramiro Cruz</a> a Mexican gunslinger investigating our fathers murder. There is a weird power system in this game called loco moves these help us by giving us extra ability such as immunity to gun etc. All in all this was a pretty good game for its standard.</dt>

<dd>Halo: Combat Evolved</dd>
<dt>This is my personal from the halo series. It has a great story line and intresting <a href="https://screenrant.com/halo-enemy-covenant-alien-elite-brute-banished-jackals/"> enemies</a> to say the least but. This is a more futurestic game. we crash land on a ring shaped planet and our objective is to survive and extract from the planet while learning about the advance life form and the planet itself. </dt>

<dd>Duck Hunt</dd>
<dt>Duck hunt originally released for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System">snes</a>(Super Nintendo Entertainment System). I personally got it by modding my ps1 that allowed cross play. The premise is simple we are a dog with a gun hunting ducks and the simplicity is what made me love it.</dt>
